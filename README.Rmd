## Overview


The R package `rgeoservices` is a R client streamlining access to the services provided by the French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN) through its open access [Geoplatform](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/services/services-geoplateforme).

**N.B.** This platform offers services to retrieve geographical information only for France.


## Features

Currently `rgeoservices` can access to the following services:

- [**Geocoding service**](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/services/services-geoplateforme/geocodage) to obtain the geographic coordinates of an address or a point of interest. The reverse operation is also possible.
- [**Altimetry service**](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/services/services-geoplateforme/altimetrie) to obtain the altitude of a geographical point and a longitudinal profile.
- [**Route planner service**](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/services/services-geoplateforme/itineraire) to obtain a route between two points.
- [**Isochrone/Isodistance service**](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/services/services-geoplateforme/itineraire) to get to the accessible area within a certain travel time/distance.


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Install 'remotes' package (if not already installed) ----
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## Install 'rgeoservices' from GitHub ----
remotes::install_github("ahasverus/rgeoservices")
```

Then you can attach the package `rgeoservices`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("rgeoservices")
```



## Get started

For an overview of the main features of `rgeoservices`, please read the
[Reference](https://ahasverus.github.io/rgeoservices/articles/rgeoservices.html) page.

**N.B.** A vignette will be available soon.
